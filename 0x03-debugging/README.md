# C-Debugging
## 0-main.c
>Testing the `0-positive_or_negative.c` file. `0-main.c` file changed to check if 0 is correctly identified.
- Adaptation of variables, if, else, while to compile with the main file to test locally.

## 1-main.c
>Dealing with inifinite loops - commenting the bad code out .

## 2-largest_number.c
>Fixing the code to correctly identify the largest number out of three numbers.

## 3-print_remainning_days.c
>Fixed the `print_remainig _days()` function so that the output works correctly fo all dates and all leap years.
- You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
- You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
