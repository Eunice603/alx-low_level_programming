# C - Variables, if, else, while

## 0-positive_or_negative.c
>This programm assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. The output is `The number` followed by `n `:

- if the number is greater than 0: is positive
- if the number is 0: is zero
- if the number is less than 0: is negative
## 1-last_digit.c
>The program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.

>The output is the string `Last digit of`, followed by `n`, followed by the string `is`, followed by `n`:
- if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
- if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
- if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
## 2-print_alphabet.c
>A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
